# Plate Buster Version 1 

This version is basic implementation of our idea of reading number plate from an image. We have used image processing techniques as well as an OCR to reach our visualised goal. 

There are some aspects to cover such as filtering unnecessary characters that the OCR takes into account. 

In the future version of our idea , we will be implementing our objective using neural network models.
